# WebApplicationVulnerabilityScanner

- This is an automated DAST tool to scan for vulnerabilities within web applications. 
    - Currently working on the backend logic to look for such vulnerabilities. 

- How to use tool:
    - Run the directories: BackEnd, web-application-vulnerability-scanner, and 
    web-application-vulnerability-scanner-middle, in this order
        - In terminal:

            - ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        - In separate terminal:
            - cd web-application-vulnerability-scanner-middle

            - npm start
    
- FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS: 
    - Account for users 
    - Basic information about vulnerabilities
    - Display suggestd code to secure different types of vulnereabilities
